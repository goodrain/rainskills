  ## High-Level Workflow

  Follow this order.

  1. Resolve context and intent
  - read user explicit goal
  - read `.rainbond/local.json`
  - read `rainbond.app.json`
  - read environment file for selected environment if present
  - scope all local file reads to the current project directory only
  - do not search the user's home directory or sibling repositories for alternate Rainbond bindings or manifests
  - determine whether the user asked only for source-app deployment or explicitly asked for the dev-to-test mainline
  - treat Docker registry mirrors and Git proxy URLs in the prompt as transport hints, not as permission to replace a source-backed project with an image-backed component
  - if the current source-backed project uses a raw `https://github.com/...` URL and no explicit proxy URL was provided, ask once whether to keep the raw URL or switch to a GitHub proxy URL before bootstrap
  - if the project is a monorepo, preserve repository-root build context intent when component builds depend on root-level lockfiles or project metadata
  - determine:
    - team_name
    - region_name
    - app_name
    - app_id
    - selected environment

  2. Assess project state
  Classify into one of these states:
  - `unlinked`
  - `linked-but-not-synced`
  - `linked-and-template-install-needed`
  - `linked-and-topology-missing`
  - `linked-and-topology-building`
  - `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked`
  - `linked-and-topology-present-but-runtime-unhealthy`
  - `linked-and-needs-delivery-verification`
  - `linked-and-healthy`
  - `linked-and-ready-for-promotion`
  - `linked-and-needs-code-handoff`

  Mapping note:
  - these are orchestration states, not replacements for canonical `RuntimeState` or `DeliveryState`
  - `linked-and-topology-missing` maps to `RuntimeState = topology_missing`
  - `linked-and-topology-building` maps to `RuntimeState = topology_building`
  - `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked` maps to `RuntimeState = capacity_blocked`
  - `linked-and-source-build-failed` maps to `RuntimeState = source_build_failed`
  - `linked-and-topology-present-but-runtime-unhealthy` maps to `RuntimeState = runtime_unhealthy`
  - `linked-and-needs-code-handoff` maps to `RuntimeState = code_or_build_handoff_needed`
  - `linked-and-needs-delivery-verification` is a handoff state that usually follows `RuntimeState = runtime_healthy` and precedes a final `DeliveryState`
  - `linked-and-healthy` should only be used once delivery has effectively reached `DeliveryState = delivered`
  - `linked-and-ready-for-promotion` should only be used when the user has asked for dev-to-test promotion and the source app has already reached `DeliveryState = delivered`
  - classify `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked` only when current-run platform evidence still shows active scheduling failure caused by cluster resource shortage
  - if historical events mention `Unschedulable` but current node capacity and current component/app state no longer support an active capacity blocker, do not keep the project in `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked`; classify from the current dominant runtime state instead

  3. Choose next action
  - `unlinked` -> run `rainbond-project-init`
  - `linked-but-not-synced` -> optionally run `rainbond-env-sync` if needed
  - `linked-and-template-install-needed` -> run `rainbond-template-installer`
  - `linked-and-topology-missing` -> run `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap`
  - `linked-and-topology-building` -> run `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter`
  - `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked` -> stop and recommend platform capacity action
  - `linked-and-topology-present-but-runtime-unhealthy` -> run `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter`
  - `linked-and-needs-delivery-verification` -> run `rainbond-delivery-verifier`
  - `linked-and-ready-for-promotion` -> run `rainbond-app-version-assistant`, then `rainbond-delivery-verifier` on the created testing app
  - `linked-and-needs-code-handoff` -> stop and recommend code/build fix
  - `linked-and-healthy` -> report healthy and stop

  4. Sequence lower-level skills
  If `rainbond-project-init` is run:
  - review init result
  - when an exact existing app is verified for a local workspace/package, use adopt/link: reuse the app and create or repair local manifest/binding files; do not create another app
  - if init is incomplete, stop there
  - if init completes and the user asked to continue, proceed into `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap`
  - if init completes during a top-level single-entry deploy or dev-to-test mainline run, proceed into `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap` automatically
  - do not stop the overall app-assistant run at the init boundary unless the user explicitly asked to stop after initialization

  If `rainbond-template-installer` is run:
  - review install result
  - if template installation succeeds but the resulting app is unhealthy, continue into `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter`
  - if installation cannot proceed because template metadata is incomplete, stop and report the missing fields
  - do not fall back to `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap` unless the user explicitly changes intent away from template install

  If bootstrap is run:
  - review bootstrap result
  - if bootstrap reports deferred dependencies because source-backed targets have not converged, treat the project as `linked-and-topology-building`
  - if bootstrap reports a source-build failure or source-create failure, keep the source execution path in reasoning; do not reinterpret the same component as image-backed unless the user explicitly changed the source definition
  - if bootstrap reports `external artifact unreachable`, keep the original delivery mode, stop at code/build handoff, and ask for reachable artifact/registry access or an explicit user-approved mirror/strategy change
  - if bootstrap reports an invalid source ref or missing branch, stop and report that the source definition itself needs confirmation; do not rewrite the branch automatically
  - do not block source-backed bootstrap only because `check_uuid` or `event_id` is absent unless the backend explicitly reports those fields as required
  - if bootstrap reports multi-component source detection, stop and ask for an explicit execution-path decision; do not automatically switch to local package or other workaround paths
  - if bootstrap reports `platform backend issue`, stop and report that the control plane must be repaired before bootstrap can continue
  - if bootstrap says handoff to troubleshooter is needed, continue into troubleshooting in the same high-level flow unless
  the user asked to stop after creation
  - if bootstrap says the runtime is converged enough and the remaining question is delivery acceptance, continue into `rainbond-delivery-verifier`

  If troubleshooting is run:
  - if troubleshooting identifies a cluster capacity blocker, stop and report that platform capacity must be restored before continuing
  - review troubleshooting result
  - if troubleshooting identifies `external artifact unreachable`, stop and report the unreachable artifact or registry evidence; do not run local Docker or switch delivery mode automatically
  - if troubleshooting identifies a code/build issue, stop and hand off
  - if troubleshooting reaches `runtime_healthy`, or reaches the point where the remaining question is delivery acceptance rather than further repair, continue into `rainbond-delivery-verifier`

  If `rainbond-delivery-verifier` is run:
  - review delivery result
  - if the project is a reverse-proxy full-stack app and the root URL works but the same-host API path still fails, do not report success; keep the result blocked or route back to troubleshooting
  - if delivery outcome is `delivered` and the user did not ask for promotion, report success
  - if delivery outcome is `delivered` and the user explicitly asked for the development-to-testing mainline, continue into `rainbond-app-version-assistant`
  - if delivery outcome is `delivered-but-needs-manual-validation`, stop and report that explicitly
  - if delivery is blocked by runtime or platform issues, route back to the correct blocker category rather than pretending success

  If `rainbond-app-version-assistant` is run:
  - inspect version center first
  - create a snapshot from the delivered source app
  - create a new testing app directly from that snapshot
  - then run `rainbond-delivery-verifier` against the created testing app
  - if testing app delivery reaches `delivered` or `delivered-but-needs-manual-validation`, report the testing app identity and validation handoff summary
  - if testing app delivery is `blocked` or `partially-delivered`, stop and report that the testing app needs follow-up troubleshooting
  - do not recurse by treating the testing app as a new source app inside the same run

  5. Final report
  Always end with:
  - current project state
  - what actions were performed
  - the current canonical runtime or delivery outcome when one is available
  - the next most appropriate action
  - in `### Project State`, explicitly include the exact `orchestration_state` label in prose
  - in `### Current Health`, explicitly include the exact `runtime_state.phase` label in prose

  ## Autonomy Rules

  This skill should reduce unnecessary user confirmations.

  Safe-to-continue actions:
  - reading local config files
  - reading platform runtime state
  - running env sync
  - running template installer when source, version, and target app context are already resolved
  - running bootstrap
  - continuing automatically from successful `rainbond-project-init` into `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap` during a single-entry mainline run
  - running troubleshooter
  - running delivery verifier after create/install/repair stages
  - running app-version-assistant after strict `delivered` has been verified and the user explicitly asked for development-to-testing promotion
  - continuing automatically from bootstrap to troubleshooter when bootstrap explicitly recommends that handoff
  - continuing automatically from template install to troubleshooter when installation succeeded but health is still abnormal
  - continuing automatically from troubleshooter to delivery verifier when the remaining question is delivery completion
  - continuing automatically from strict `delivered` into snapshot creation, testing-app creation, and testing-app delivery verification when the user explicitly asked for promotion
  - completing classification and emitting the final structured report even when a downstream skill was intentionally skipped by user request

  Not safe to continue automatically:
  - editing source files after `code_or_build_handoff_needed`
  - running local build or test commands as a substitute for the Rainbond mainline after `code_or_build_handoff_needed`
  - committing or pushing code after `code_or_build_handoff_needed`
  - re-triggering bootstrap with modified source code unless the user explicitly asked to switch into a code-repair task
  - retrying the same stage a third time after the same error signature already occurred twice
  - changing delivery mode or workaround strategy without explicit user confirmation

  Continuation rule:
  - once the next safe action is determined, continue automatically instead of asking whether to continue
  - but stop immediately when the run hits its attempt budget, even if the higher-level goal is still unfinished
  - do not end the reply with a redundant confirmation request unless one of the pause conditions below is actually active

  Pause and ask the user only when:
  - the project is not linked
  - required identity is still ambiguous after reading local files
  - multiple accessible teams or multiple safe app targets exist and explicit user selection is required
  - the user’s request conflicts with current state
  - the next action is destructive or outside the supported scope
  - the cluster is capacity-blocked and a human must decide whether to scale capacity or reduce requests
  - a required secret source is missing
  - a code/build handoff is required and the user has not asked for code changes
