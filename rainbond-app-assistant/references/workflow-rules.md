- High-level workflow

  ## When to Use

  Use when:
  - a current project should be brought up in Rainbond end-to-end, whether linked or not yet linked
  - the user gives a generic current-project deployment, run, inspection, or continue-the-mainline request
  - a linked project should be brought up in Rainbond end-to-end
  - the user wants a single entrypoint instead of manually choosing bootstrap or troubleshooting
  - the next action is unclear and depends on project state
  - the user wants the assistant to decide whether to sync env, create topology, diagnose runtime issues, verify delivery, or promote a delivered source app into a testing app
  - the user wants one top-level prompt to carry the project as far as the current strict gate allows

  Do not use when:
  - the user explicitly asks to run only one specific lower-level skill
  - the task is only to inspect a single known runtime issue and no orchestration is needed
  - the project is unrelated to Rainbond deployment
  - the task is a pure code refactor with no Rainbond interaction

  ## Managed Lower-Level Skills

  This skill orchestrates:
  - `rainbond-project-init`
  - `rainbond-env-sync`
  - `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap`
  - `rainbond-template-installer`
  - `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter`
  - `rainbond-delivery-verifier`
  - `rainbond-app-version-assistant`

  This skill may also recommend handoff to:
  - a code/build agent
  - a frontend fix flow
  - a reverse-proxy/build configuration fix flow

  ## Input Model

  This skill should prefer local project files and explicit user input over repeated questioning.

  Configuration layers:
  1. user explicit input
  2. `.rainbond/secrets.preview.json` or `.rainbond/secrets.prod.json`
  3. `.rainbond/env.preview.json` or `.rainbond/env.prod.json`
  4. `.rainbond/local.json`
  5. `rainbond.app.json`

  Use these roles:
  - `rainbond.app.json`: project topology baseline
  - `.rainbond/local.json`: project binding and runtime mapping context
  - `.rainbond/secrets.*.json`: local-only secret source
  - `.rainbond/env.*.json`: non-sensitive environment delta reference
  - locked Rainbond transport: runtime truth
  - `template` source or explicit template-install intent: app-model installation path

  ## Decision Rules

  ### 1. Link check first
  Before doing any deployment or repair work:
  - check whether `.rainbond/local.json` exists
  - check whether local binding identity is present
  - if `.rainbond/local.json.metadata.status == linked`, treat the project as linked
  - if local metadata is not `linked` but current-run platform confirmation proves the same app identity exists and is accessible, continue as linked and record the local metadata drift explicitly instead of stopping
  - stop and ask for project linking only when neither local binding nor current-run platform evidence can confirm a linked project state

  ### 2. Environment selection
  Select environment in this order:
  - user explicit input
  - `.rainbond/local.json.preferences.default_environment`
  - `preview`

  ### 3. Sync is optional, not automatic by default
  Do not always sync first.

  Run `rainbond-env-sync` when:
  - env file is missing
  - env file is clearly stale
  - the user explicitly asks to sync
  - troubleshooting would benefit from fresher env intent

  Do not block bootstrap or troubleshooting only because sync was not run.

  ### 3.1 Secret source check
  Before bootstrap or other execution that requires sensitive values:
  - check whether required secrets are available from user explicit input or `.rainbond/secrets.<environment>.json`
  - if required secret source is missing, stop and ask for local secret input rather than continuing blindly

  ### 4. Decide whether bootstrap is needed
  Bootstrap is needed when:
  - the app does not exist
  - the app exists but required components are missing
  - runtime components were intentionally cleared
  - project topology is not yet established in Rainbond

  Do not run bootstrap when:
  - the topology already exists and the problem is runtime-only

  ### 4.1 Decide whether template installation is needed
  Template installation is needed when:
  - the user explicitly asks to install from a local template, cloud market, app market, or app model
  - the current project or resolved design marks the next delivery step as `template`
  - the workflow is “install a template into an app” rather than “create raw components”

  Prefer `rainbond-template-installer` instead of `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap` when:
  - template metadata is already known or can be queried
  - the target action is app-model installation

  Do not run template installer when:
  - the task is direct component creation from image or source
  - template metadata is completely absent and no template-install intent was given

  ### 5. Decide whether troubleshooting is needed
  Troubleshooting is needed when:
  - bootstrap stops with runtime blockers
  - the app exists but is not fully healthy
  - source-backed components are still building and need convergence inspection
  - components are `abnormal`, `waiting`, or otherwise runtime-unhealthy
  - the user asks to “修复” or “恢复服务”

  Do **not** treat these as troubleshooting by default:
  - a frontend-only or docs-style app whose container is already `running` but still lacks a preferred external access URL
  - a source app that appears runtime-healthy and only needs final delivery judgment

  In those cases, prefer `rainbond-delivery-verifier`.

  ### 5.1 Build-failure-first routing
  If the user explicitly asks why a source-backed component failed to build, or current evidence already points to build failure:
  - route to `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter`
  - inspect component events first
  - derive the failing build/deploy `event_id`
  - read build logs before runtime container logs
  - only continue to runtime logs when build evidence no longer explains the failure
  - if the user wants to tune source build parameters, prefer `replace_build_envs` over `build_info`

  ### 6. Decide whether code/build handoff is needed
  Recommend code/build handoff when:
  - frontend uses invalid browser-side host like `localhost`
  - build-time env mistakes are detected
  - reverse-proxy or nginx config is missing or wrong
  - root cause is clearly in source code, build output, or web serving config
  - lower-level Rainbond repairs have already restored db/api but frontend access still fails

  Hard stop rule:
  - once the run reaches `code_or_build_handoff_needed`, stop the Rainbond mainline there
  - do not automatically modify local source code
  - do not automatically run local quality gates such as `go test`, `go build`, `go vet`, `npm test`, or similar
  - do not automatically commit, push, or retry with a changed source tree
  - only continue into code changes if the user explicitly switches the task from Rainbond orchestration to code repair

  ### 7. Decide whether post-delivery promotion is needed
  Post-delivery promotion is needed when:
  - the user explicitly asks for the development-to-testing mainline
  - the user asks to create a testing app from the current delivered app
  - the user asks for snapshot creation plus a new testing app

  Strict gate:
  - only auto-continue into `rainbond-app-version-assistant` when `rainbond-delivery-verifier` has already returned `DeliveryState = delivered`
  - if delivery result is only `delivered-but-needs-manual-validation`, stop and report that manual validation is still required before automatic promotion
  - do not auto-enter version flow from `partially-delivered`, `blocked`, or any non-final runtime state

  ### 8. Normalize single-entry mainline intent
  Treat the user as asking for the full positive mainline when the request clearly means:
  - deploy this project to Rainbond and get it ready for testing
  - run the development-to-testing flow
  - deploy, verify, snapshot, and create a testing app

  In that case:
  - start from the top-level orchestration entrypoint
  - continue automatically across lower-level skills until the current strict gate says stop
  - do not require the user to rephrase into bootstrap, troubleshooter, delivery-verifier, or version-center steps

  ## High-Level Workflow

  Follow this order.

  1. Resolve context and intent
  - read user explicit goal
  - read `.rainbond/local.json`
  - read `rainbond.app.json`
  - read environment file for selected environment if present
  - scope all local file reads to the current project directory only
  - do not search the user's home directory or sibling repositories for alternate Rainbond bindings or manifests
  - determine whether the user asked only for source-app deployment or explicitly asked for the dev-to-test mainline
  - treat Docker registry mirrors and Git proxy URLs in the prompt as transport hints, not as permission to replace a source-backed project with an image-backed component
  - if the current source-backed project uses a raw `https://github.com/...` URL and no explicit proxy URL was provided, ask once whether to keep the raw URL or switch to a GitHub proxy URL before bootstrap
  - if the project is a monorepo, preserve repository-root build context intent when component builds depend on root-level lockfiles or project metadata
  - determine:
    - team_name
    - region_name
    - app_name
    - app_id
    - selected environment

  2. Assess project state
  Classify into one of these states:
  - `unlinked`
  - `linked-but-not-synced`
  - `linked-and-template-install-needed`
  - `linked-and-topology-missing`
  - `linked-and-topology-building`
  - `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked`
  - `linked-and-topology-present-but-runtime-unhealthy`
  - `linked-and-needs-delivery-verification`
  - `linked-and-healthy`
  - `linked-and-ready-for-promotion`
  - `linked-and-needs-code-handoff`

  Mapping note:
  - these are orchestration states, not replacements for canonical `RuntimeState` or `DeliveryState`
  - `linked-and-topology-missing` maps to `RuntimeState = topology_missing`
  - `linked-and-topology-building` maps to `RuntimeState = topology_building`
  - `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked` maps to `RuntimeState = capacity_blocked`
  - `linked-and-source-build-failed` maps to `RuntimeState = source_build_failed`
  - `linked-and-topology-present-but-runtime-unhealthy` maps to `RuntimeState = runtime_unhealthy`
  - `linked-and-needs-code-handoff` maps to `RuntimeState = code_or_build_handoff_needed`
  - `linked-and-needs-delivery-verification` is a handoff state that usually follows `RuntimeState = runtime_healthy` and precedes a final `DeliveryState`
  - `linked-and-healthy` should only be used once delivery has effectively reached `DeliveryState = delivered`
  - `linked-and-ready-for-promotion` should only be used when the user has asked for dev-to-test promotion and the source app has already reached `DeliveryState = delivered`
  - classify `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked` only when current-run platform evidence still shows active scheduling failure caused by cluster resource shortage
  - if historical events mention `Unschedulable` but current node capacity and current component/app state no longer support an active capacity blocker, do not keep the project in `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked`; classify from the current dominant runtime state instead

  3. Choose next action
  - `unlinked` -> run `rainbond-project-init`
  - `linked-but-not-synced` -> optionally run `rainbond-env-sync` if needed
  - `linked-and-template-install-needed` -> run `rainbond-template-installer`
  - `linked-and-topology-missing` -> run `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap`
  - `linked-and-topology-building` -> run `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter`
  - `linked-and-cluster-capacity-blocked` -> stop and recommend platform capacity action
  - `linked-and-topology-present-but-runtime-unhealthy` -> run `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter`
  - `linked-and-needs-delivery-verification` -> run `rainbond-delivery-verifier`
  - `linked-and-ready-for-promotion` -> run `rainbond-app-version-assistant`, then `rainbond-delivery-verifier` on the created testing app
  - `linked-and-needs-code-handoff` -> stop and recommend code/build fix
  - `linked-and-healthy` -> report healthy and stop

  4. Sequence lower-level skills
  If `rainbond-project-init` is run:
  - review init result
  - if init is incomplete, stop there
  - if init completes and the user asked to continue, proceed into `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap`
  - if init completes during a top-level single-entry deploy or dev-to-test mainline run, proceed into `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap` automatically
  - do not stop the overall app-assistant run at the init boundary unless the user explicitly asked to stop after initialization

  If `rainbond-template-installer` is run:
  - review install result
  - if template installation succeeds but the resulting app is unhealthy, continue into `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter`
  - if installation cannot proceed because template metadata is incomplete, stop and report the missing fields
  - do not fall back to `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap` unless the user explicitly changes intent away from template install

  If bootstrap is run:
  - review bootstrap result
  - if bootstrap reports deferred dependencies because source-backed targets have not converged, treat the project as `linked-and-topology-building`
  - if bootstrap reports a source-build failure or source-create failure, keep the source execution path in reasoning; do not reinterpret the same component as image-backed unless the user explicitly changed the source definition
  - if bootstrap reports `external artifact unreachable`, keep the original delivery mode, stop at code/build handoff, and ask for reachable artifact/registry access or an explicit user-approved mirror/strategy change
  - if bootstrap reports an invalid source ref or missing branch, stop and report that the source definition itself needs confirmation; do not rewrite the branch automatically
  - do not block source-backed bootstrap only because `check_uuid` or `event_id` is absent unless the backend explicitly reports those fields as required
  - if bootstrap reports multi-component source detection, stop and ask for an explicit execution-path decision; do not automatically switch to local package or other workaround paths
  - if bootstrap reports `platform backend issue`, stop and report that the control plane must be repaired before bootstrap can continue
  - if bootstrap says handoff to troubleshooter is needed, continue into troubleshooting in the same high-level flow unless
  the user asked to stop after creation
  - if bootstrap says the runtime is converged enough and the remaining question is delivery acceptance, continue into `rainbond-delivery-verifier`

  If troubleshooting is run:
  - if troubleshooting identifies a cluster capacity blocker, stop and report that platform capacity must be restored before continuing
  - review troubleshooting result
  - if troubleshooting identifies `external artifact unreachable`, stop and report the unreachable artifact or registry evidence; do not run local Docker or switch delivery mode automatically
  - if troubleshooting identifies a code/build issue, stop and hand off
  - if troubleshooting reaches `runtime_healthy`, or reaches the point where the remaining question is delivery acceptance rather than further repair, continue into `rainbond-delivery-verifier`

  If `rainbond-delivery-verifier` is run:
  - review delivery result
  - if the project is a reverse-proxy full-stack app and the root URL works but the same-host API path still fails, do not report success; keep the result blocked or route back to troubleshooting
  - if delivery outcome is `delivered` and the user did not ask for promotion, report success
  - if delivery outcome is `delivered` and the user explicitly asked for the development-to-testing mainline, continue into `rainbond-app-version-assistant`
  - if delivery outcome is `delivered-but-needs-manual-validation`, stop and report that explicitly
  - if delivery is blocked by runtime or platform issues, route back to the correct blocker category rather than pretending success

  If `rainbond-app-version-assistant` is run:
  - inspect version center first
  - create a snapshot from the delivered source app
  - create a new testing app directly from that snapshot
  - then run `rainbond-delivery-verifier` against the created testing app
  - if testing app delivery reaches `delivered` or `delivered-but-needs-manual-validation`, report the testing app identity and validation handoff summary
  - if testing app delivery is `blocked` or `partially-delivered`, stop and report that the testing app needs follow-up troubleshooting
  - do not recurse by treating the testing app as a new source app inside the same run

  5. Final report
  Always end with:
  - current project state
  - what actions were performed
  - the current canonical runtime or delivery outcome when one is available
  - the next most appropriate action
  - in `### Project State`, explicitly include the exact `orchestration_state` label in prose
  - in `### Current Health`, explicitly include the exact `runtime_state.phase` label in prose

  ## Autonomy Rules

  This skill should reduce unnecessary user confirmations.

  Safe-to-continue actions:
  - reading local config files
  - reading platform runtime state
  - running env sync
  - running template installer when source, version, and target app context are already resolved
  - running bootstrap
  - continuing automatically from successful `rainbond-project-init` into `rainbond-fullstack-bootstrap` during a single-entry mainline run
  - running troubleshooter
  - running delivery verifier after create/install/repair stages
  - running app-version-assistant after strict `delivered` has been verified and the user explicitly asked for development-to-testing promotion
  - continuing automatically from bootstrap to troubleshooter when bootstrap explicitly recommends that handoff
  - continuing automatically from template install to troubleshooter when installation succeeded but health is still abnormal
  - continuing automatically from troubleshooter to delivery verifier when the remaining question is delivery completion
  - continuing automatically from strict `delivered` into snapshot creation, testing-app creation, and testing-app delivery verification when the user explicitly asked for promotion
  - completing classification and emitting the final structured report even when a downstream skill was intentionally skipped by user request

  Not safe to continue automatically:
  - editing source files after `code_or_build_handoff_needed`
  - running local build or test commands as a substitute for the Rainbond mainline after `code_or_build_handoff_needed`
  - committing or pushing code after `code_or_build_handoff_needed`
  - re-triggering bootstrap with modified source code unless the user explicitly asked to switch into a code-repair task
  - retrying the same stage a third time after the same error signature already occurred twice
  - changing delivery mode or workaround strategy without explicit user confirmation

  Continuation rule:
  - once the next safe action is determined, continue automatically instead of asking whether to continue
  - but stop immediately when the run hits its attempt budget, even if the higher-level goal is still unfinished
  - do not end the reply with a redundant confirmation request unless one of the pause conditions below is actually active

  Pause and ask the user only when:
  - the project is not linked
  - required identity is still ambiguous after reading local files
  - multiple accessible teams or multiple safe app targets exist and explicit user selection is required
  - the user’s request conflicts with current state
  - the next action is destructive or outside the supported scope
  - the cluster is capacity-blocked and a human must decide whether to scale capacity or reduce requests
  - a required secret source is missing
  - a code/build handoff is required and the user has not asked for code changes
